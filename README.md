# How-to-Create-a-Functional-Analog-Clock-Using-PyQt-and-QML
QML is a declarative language that allows user interfaces to be described in terms of their visual components 
and how they interact and relate with one another. It is a highly readable language that was designed to enable 
components to be interconnected in a dynamic manner, and it allows components to be easily reused and customized 
within a user interface. Using the QtQuick module, designers and developers can easily build fluid animated user 
interfaces in QML, and have the option of connecting these user interfaces to any back-end C++ libraries.

This tutorial shows how to create a functional analog clock using PyQt5 and QML.

# The following is a video demonstrating the output of this code.
